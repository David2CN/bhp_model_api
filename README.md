# Pressure Prediction API
This API uses an ML model to predict the flowing bottomhole pressure in an oil well. <br>
It uses the following features:
1. Annular pressure (AVG_ANNULUS_PRESS)
2. Wellhead temperature (AVG_WHT_P)
3. Choke size (DP_CHOKE_SIZE)
4. Number of days since production started (DAYS_1STPRD)
